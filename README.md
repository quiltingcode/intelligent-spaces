## Credits

* I referred back to the Cave of Query portfolio project that I created, when joining two columns of data together; the issue date and issue time columns

* I found this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21620602/add-leading-zero-python) article to help format the time data, to add missing zeros to make all the times 4 digits and then I added a ':' between each time, before concatenating it with the date

* I've imported date from the datatime library to help format the missing date fields in the Plate Expiry Date column
